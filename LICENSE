Geometry-as-Product Clarification
----------------------------------------------------------------

The subject of this license includes not only expressive content but also functional geometric
configurations, including but not limited to lattice topology, curvature–lattice coupling,
node reinforcement logic, and scale-invariant geometric relationships embodied in the provided
CAD and manufacturing files.

For the avoidance of doubt, the STL, OBJ, STEP, 3MF, and related geometry files constitute the
product itself, not merely illustrative representations. Any reproduction, modification,
rescaling, parameter variation, or derivative geometry that preserves substantially similar
structural, topological, or functional characteristics is considered a derivative work under
this license.

Minor geometric modifications, rescaling, slicer-based regeneration, or format conversion do
not exempt derivative works from the commercial licensing requirement.

Commercial manufacture, deployment, distribution, or derivative commercial use requires a
separate written license from the author.
